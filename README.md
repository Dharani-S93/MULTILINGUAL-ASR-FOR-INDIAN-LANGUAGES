The project "Multilingual Code Switching ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) " targets the development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology for Tamil-English speech within India. Tamil, culturally significant in southern India, is merged with English, a global language, reflecting India's bilingual nature. An End-to-End (E2E) framework is utilized, enhancing accuracy and addressing bilingualism and code-switching challenges. The project aligns with existing research. A study proposes a Semantic Dataset Creation approach leveraging Wav2Vec 2.0 (XLSR53) for multilingual ASR, reporting a WER of 26.22%. Another explores E2E ASR for Ethiopian languages with a 29.83% WER. A dual-script E2E framework improved WER by 5-6%. IITG-INDIGO's ASR systems achieved a WER of 30.73%, slightly lower in transliterated WER. Large Language Models (LLMs) reduced WER by 6.2%, especially in code- switching scenarios.
Here, the task is to create an accurate transcription of the inputs, handle code-switching inputs, and produce a Tamil-English ASR utilizing Seq2Seq within E2E models. Goals include tackling multilingual issues and drastically lowering the Word Error Rate (WER). Preprocessing audio data for normalization, feature extraction, and noise reduction is covered in length in the module description. The encoder-decoder architecture of Seq2Seq is used for training, together with transformer-based End-End models for translation and A Beam Search Algorithm for decoding. Voice assistants, transcribing services, and accessibility tools are the main areas of deployment. Seq2Seq's effectiveness in managing variable-length inputs is demonstrated by the results, which show promising accuracy with WER and CER within reasonable limits. To sum up, this effort enhances multilingual ASR, especially for Tamil-English, and shows how E2E Seq2Seq models can be used to improve inclusion and communication in a variety of linguistic contexts.
